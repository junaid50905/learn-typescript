typescript is nothing but type safety
```
console.log(2+"2")

Result: '22'
```
it gives us the odd result because of the missing type

### How we will be beneficial by writing ts code 
- Type Safety
- Code Maintainability
- Code will be more readable
- Early Error Detection



### There are a lot of types in typescript

### Syntex
```
let varName: type = value
```
