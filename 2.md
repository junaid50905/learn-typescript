typescript is nothing but type safety
```
console.log(2+"2")

Result: '22'
```
it gives us the odd result because of the missing type

### Here is another example of the typescript

Wrong way to write
```
function grettings(name, age){
    return `Hi, ${name} your age is ${age}`
}
console.log(grettings("junaid", "12"));

```
For this code, age is a string but it is not possible that age is a string. so, for this code, typescript generates an error for initializing the type of the arguments.


The right way to write
```
function grettings(name:string, age:number){
    return `Hi, ${name} your age is ${age}`
}
console.log(grettings("junaid", 12));
```




### How we will be beneficial by writing ts code
- Type Safety
- Code Maintainability
- Code will be more readable
- Early Error Detection



### There are a lot of types in typescript

### Don't use any type

### Syntex
```
let varName: type = value
```
