typescript is nothing but type safety
```
console.log(2+"2")

Result: '22'
```
it gives us the odd result because of the missing type

### Here is another example of the typescript

Wrong way to write
```
function grettings(name, age){
    return `Hi, ${name} your age is ${age}`
}
console.log(grettings("junaid", "12"));

```
For this code, age is a string but it is not possible that age is a string. so, for this code, typescript generates an error for initializing the type of the arguments.


The right way to write
```
function grettings(name:string, age:number){
    return `Hi, ${name} your age is ${age}`
}
console.log(grettings("junaid", 12));
```




### How we will be beneficial by writing ts code
- Type Safety
- Code Maintainability
- Code will be more readable
- Early Error Detection



### There are a lot of types in typescript

### Don't use any type

### Syntex
```
let varName: type = value
```



### Work with function

##### function with parameter type and default value
```
function grettings(name:string, age:number, city: string = "Dhaka"){
    return `Hi, ${name} your age is ${age} and you lives in ${city}`
}
console.log(grettings("junaid", 12));

```

##### function with return type

wrong code : for the following code, the function does not have a return type, that's why it doesn't show any error and returns a string. but we want to return a number that will add the two numebers 
```
function sum(numOne:number, numTwo: number) {
    return "hi"
}
console.log(sum(2,3));
```

right code: Now, if we return a string then the editor will give a type error. so we have to write return type as well as parameter type
```
function sum(numOne:number, numTwo: number):number {
    return numOne + numTwo
}
console.log(sum(2,3));
```
