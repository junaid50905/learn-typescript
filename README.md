## learn typescript

#### what is typescript?
- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing which means allowing develoepers to add types
- "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
- created by Microsoft
- covert the ts code into vanilla js

#### Why should I use TypeScript?
- Static typing: TypeScript provides static typing, which means that you can specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return types. This can help catch     errors at compile-time rather than run-time, making it easier to debug code.
- IDE support: TypeScript provides better IDE support than JavaScript, including code completion, refactoring, and error highlighting.
- Code maintainability: TypeScript's static typing and interfaces can make your code more maintainable by providing a clear structure and preventing common errors.
- Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. You can gradually       introduce TypeScript into an existing JavaScript project.
- Community support: TypeScript is backed by Microsoft and has a large and active community, which means that there are many resources and libraries available to help     you get started and solve problems.
